Showcasing example programs that I made while learning C. These are mostly for assignments at university.  

### object-oriented

I took a class about object-oriented computer programming principles in java. 
We also covered inheritance and polymorphism.

### data-structures-and-algorithms

I took another class in java which focused on different data structures and algorithms, reinforcing the object-oriented principles learned in the other class. 

This repository contains assignments I completed from both of these classes which showcase various skills related to coding in java.
